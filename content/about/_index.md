I develop state-of-the-art models to advance applied and theoretical methods for ecology and environmental management. My research area spans from big data analysis at local to global scales and includes field to laboratory experiments on vertebrates and invertebrates and their association with marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. I examine how their responses vary with time and space in relation to variable climates. I work at the interface of data science, macroecology, spatial modeling, uncertainty, and quantitative risk assessment to guide the best scientific and management decision processes. 

For example, as part of my MSc thesis, I have investigated the [conservation status of a marine elasmobranch (i.e., sawfish) in Bangladesh](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2466). For my MPhil research, I was involved in a project to investigate the impact of global climate change on [freshwater crayfish](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12831) and how does the [uncetainty of global climate projections affects the climate change vulnerability assessments](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12936). In my PhD, I investigated the [patterns of distribution and adaptive strategies of Australian grasshoppers in response to variable environmental conditions](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/d6602761-b9e9-4dc1-b52d-e0ceb9bae69a). In collaboration with my supervisors, I also created a [database](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2fqz612sn) of [Australian grasshopper occurrences](https://doi.org/10.1111/aen.12628) from historic field survey notebooks spanning 54 years. I use R, ArcGIS, Python, and high-performance computing systems for my data analysis. 

Based on my academic achievements, I was awarded the prestigious Melbourne Research Scholarship twice, to study for a Master of Philosophy and then a Doctor of Philosophy in Science at the University of Melbourne. In addition, I was awarded a prestigious Gold Medal for achieving the highest grades in my Wildlife cohort during my MSc, and a Dean's Award for overall academic excellence during my BSc (Hons) courses at the University of Dhaka. My track record of academic excellence, publications in international peer-reviewed journals, and winning grants and awards demonstrates my skills as a researcher.

Recently I have passed my PhD and several small research contracts with the [Climatic and Metabolic Ecology Lab](https://camel.science.unimelb.edu.au/) as well as the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group](qaeco.com) at the University of Melbourne. Currently, I am working for the publication of my thesis chapters and actively looking for opportunities in academia and research.
